ROCK VS MINE PREDICTION💣
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine based on given input features. The model was implemented and trained using Google Colab with Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

✨FEATURES
🔹Data preprocessing and feature engineering
🔹Model training and evaluation
🔹Prediction of new samples
🔹Visualization of results and model performance

🛠TECK STACK
1.Python
2.NumPy & Pandas 📈 for data handling
3.Scikit-learn for model building
4.Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
5.Google Colab for development and execution

🚀USAGE
1.Open the notebook in Google Colab
2.Run all cells to train the model and make predictions
3.Use the provided input format to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine

📝NOTES
1.The notebook includes detailed explanations of each step
2.Model predictions can be exported as CSV or visualized directly in Colab
